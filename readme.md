# Covid19 Tweets Sentiment Analysis | NLP

  Sentiment analysis is one of the Natural Language Processing fields, dedicated to the exploration of subjective opinions or feelings collected from various sources about a particular subject.

  This is a detailed example of a Text Classification project. It includes a variety of visualizations, rare libraries, and different algorithms. The tweets have been pulled from Twitter and manual tagging has been done then. After a detailed text cleaning,  tweets have been classified as "positive", "negative" and "notr".  Sentiments have predicted with different algorithms. The best algorithm has an 83% f-1 score.

### Prerequisites

I have worked on Jypter Notebook & Python 3. It could be useful to check the packages&libraries documentaries which I used. 
sklearn, nltk, emot, re, BeautifulSoup, pyspellchecker, Counter etc.


## Acknowledgments

It was a basic NLP project but while I was working on it I researched and learned a lot though. Here are the best practices for you.
